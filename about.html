            <p>The critic Kenneth Burke once called literature “equipment for living.”<br> He viewed poems, proverbs,
                plays, and novels as <strong> “a ritualistic way of arming us to confront perplexities and
                    risks.”</strong> But is this insight limited to literature? <br>
                The purpose of this class was to examine media technologies in general as equipment for living, and to
                apply this theory to digital image-making and world-building.
